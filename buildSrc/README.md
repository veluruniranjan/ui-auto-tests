# TestRail synchronization

TestRail synchronization plugin can be used to pull test cases from TestRail, push updated cases to TestRail and update TestRail test run with test results from cucumber reports file

**!N.B.** This plugin is able to sync only feature files in Gherkin format and the results, generated by Cucumber in `json` format (using `json` and `pretty` plugins)

## Set up

### TestRail project structure

TestRail suits are parsed to the feature files using next logic:  
- TestRail suite should have exactly 2 levels structure
- First level section is translated to the folder
- Second level section is translated to the feature file. The description of this section becomes feature "Background"
- Every test case under second level section is translated to the scenario
- Test cases on any level different from the second one will be not parsed

Every feature file starts with `@sidXXX` tag, where `XXX` is TestRail section id .Every scenario starts with `@tidXXX` tag, where `XXX` is TestRail case id.  
This tags are required to push test cases or test results to the TestRail. On pull test-cases from TestRail those tags will be added automatically.

### Adding the plugin to build.gradle

```gradle 
plugins {
    id 'com.zenjob.testrailsync'
}
```
And after `plugins` section:
```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.zenjob.testrailsync'
```
